2024 DivHacks Project.

This chrome manifest v3 extension was built for DivHacks 2024. 

Currently there is a problem with fashion, where companies use unethical labor to create their clothes. This chrome extension detects and pulls from a database to show if a company has a product that uses unethical labor.
